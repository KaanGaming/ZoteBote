# ZoteBote

ZoteBote is a Discord bot, whose single purpose is to send Zote's 57 Precepts in chat.

## Add Bot

[Add this bot to your Discord server! (You must have Manage Server permissions)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=938469673228468296&permissions=274877910080&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

## Usage

You can just grab the .exe from Releases, and run the program! You must first create a Discord bot to run your own instance of ZoteBote though.

[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

The program will request a token to run the bot. You must grab the token from the bot you created, in the Bot page, and copy the token to the program. It will save it in a local file in the exact same place as the .exe file, and use that token from now on. If you want to change it, simply delete the file and run the program again.
